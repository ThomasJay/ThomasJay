### Hi, I'm Thomas Jay


## 

I'm a software engineer with a passion for startups.

I enjoy learning new technologies and teaching.

I focus mainly on Mobile, lots of React Native, iOS (Objetive-C and Swift) as well as Android (Java).

I work on lots of back end API's with Java / Spring Boot, Node.js / Express as well as Servless AWS / Lambda's.

I love IoT systems, from Medical devices to Ag Tech, I have a home Hydroponics system and live on 10 Acres so its not a small system :)

I'm located near San Francisco in the Sierra Foothills.

Feel free to checkout any of my public projects, I create these as I give classes to help students learn and as a resource.

I also have a few Udemy Classes, freel free to check them out.
